Mindset

Carol Dweck's speech on the power of yet vs the tyranny
of now was inspiring. She demonstrated how we always have
the chance to do better than we are doing now by using
the not yet approach. This mindset prevents us from setting
limitations on our learning capabilities. I like the idea
of praising the process rather than the outcome so that we 
learn from our experiences.

My results from the Mindset quiz was a 46 and in the strong
growth mindset category. It was close to the bottom of that
category, reminding me that I could improve upon my current
mindset. I hope it will affect my outlook going forward that
I may continue to see possibilities and the opportunities for
change instead of thinking perspectives are finite. I would
like to read her book and improve upon my role as a mother and
teacher to my son.
