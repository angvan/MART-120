GUI and Command Line

Learning command line interface after using graphical user interface
for so long requires a whole new way of navigating the computer system.
GUI is obviously a more visual method with icons to guide you through 
the system whereas CLI is not visual at all. You cannot simply use a mouse
to click here and there, or stumble through CLI like you can in GUI; you 
really need to know your commands (entered on a keyboard) and how to use them 
otherwise you will get nowhere. Or possibly even mess up your system in a 
way that isn't possible in GUI. In CLI, folders are called directories. We 
navigate through the system in CLI but browse the system in GUI. Files in
GUI are saved with file extensions; however, extensions are not necessary
when using CLI.

As a visual learner, and perhaps simply because I have only used GUI on
a computer, I find CLI very challenging to use. Fun, but challenging. 
Memorizing commands and what they do is a lot of information to absorb,
but even beyond that, just getting my brain to interact with the computer
system in a completely different manner is like relearning how to ride
a bike with your eyes closed. With that being said, I am quite looking
forward to becoming proficient using CLI so that I can be more 
savvy in my understanding and utilization of code.
