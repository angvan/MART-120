     <p>An orange ruled the world.</p>

     <p>It was an unexpected thing, the temporary abdication of Heavenly Providence, entrusting the whole matter to a simple orange.</p>

     <p>The orange, in a grove in Florida, humbly accepted the honor. The other oranges, the birds, and the men in their tractors wept with joy;<br>
        the tractors' motors rumbled hymns of praise.</p>

     <p>Airplane pilots passing over would circle the grove and tell their passengers, "Below us is the grove where the orange who rules the world<br>
        grows on a simple branch." And the passengers would be silent with awe.</p>

     <p>The governor of Florida declared every day a holiday. On summer afternoons the Dalai Lama would come to the grove and sit with the orange,<br>
        and talk about life.</p>

     <p>When the time came for the orange to be picked, none of the migrant workers would do it: they went on strike. The foremen wept.<br>
        The other oranges swore they would turn sour. But the orange who ruled the world said, "No, my friends; it is time."</p>

     <p>Finally a man from Chicago, with a heart as windy and cold as Lake Michigan in wintertime, was brought in. He put down his briefcase,<br>
        climbed up on a ladder, and picked the orange. The birds were silent and the clouds had gone away. The orange thanked the man from Chicago.</p>

     <p>They say that when the orange went through the national produce processing and distribution system, certain machines turned to gold,<br>
        truck drivers had epiphanies, aging rural store managers called their estranged lesbian daughters on Wall Street and all was forgiven.</p>

     <p>I bought the orange who ruled the world for 39 cents at Safeway three days ago, and for three days he sat in my fruit basket and was my teacher.<br>
        Today, he told me, "it is time," and I ate him.</p>

     <p> Now we are on our own again.</p>
