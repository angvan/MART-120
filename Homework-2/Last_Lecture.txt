The Last Lecture

The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch contained many anecdotes and reflections on life. 
Overall, I think it was a pleasant lecture filled with interesting tidbits from Dr. Pausch’s life. 
I like how he addressed his childhood dreams and showed where he either achieved them or 
learned something by not achieving them. My favorite quote from him was “experience is what 
you get when you didn’t get what you wanted.” I can relate to that one in terms of the experience 
being far more valuable to my character development than what the thing I wanted would have given 
me. Many of his reflections were interesting to consider, although most of them were not 
earth-shattering observations. At the end of his lecture, he mentioned his second head fake being 
that the lecture was designed for his children not for the audience. That made a lot of sense to 
me since his lecture was more of an autobiography than an inspirational talk. I can see how it 
would mean more to his family and friends than to strangers.
	

I did appreciate his upbeat and positive attitude throughout the lecture especially considering his 
life expectancy. It is honorable that he approached the topic of his life as more of a celebration 
than being morose about his diagnosis. The part that affected me the most was when he wished his wife
happy birthday. That choked me up a little bit, watching her cry over his surprise for her and knowing 
that it was probably the last birthday she spent with him. I am sure she was thinking the same thing when 
she went up and hugged him. It was touching. The thing I liked least about his lecture was when he was 
showing the virtual reality project that some of his students made. I found the entire project quite 
cringe-worthy and did not enjoy watching it in the least. That being said, his extensive accomplishments 
and the legacy he has left for future CS students is something to be admired. He achieved much career 
success in his short 47 years.
